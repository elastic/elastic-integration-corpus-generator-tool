# Performances

Performances while generating data are a key element, as they:
- allow generating big quantities of data
- allow generating data on demand
- allow re-generating data when needed

Achieving maximum performances has also some disadvantages, mainly around feature-completeness.

This tool aims to support uses cases where is needed to trade features for performances and use cases where this isn't needed, but without compromising performances too much (max 10x less performant).

This tool comes with a benchmark testsuite that can be run to evaluate new features performance impact.
