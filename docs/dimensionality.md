# Dimensionality

The dimensionality of a dataset is the number of fields that it has. **High dimensionality** datasets have many attributes.

Dimensionality plays a role in `array` and `object` type fields.

Dimensionality is valuable to test storage consumption, in particular for metrics, where the data point itself is small compared to the metadata enriching it.

At the moment the number of attribute for these fields is random and is not configurable through Field generation configurations.
